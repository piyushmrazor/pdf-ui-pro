## 🔴 Important Notes

### Current Linting Errors

You may see 3 linting errors in `store.ts`:
- ❌ Cannot find module '@reduxjs/toolkit'
- ❌ Property 'env' does not exist

**These will disappear after running `npm install`** ✅

The errors are expected because:
1. Dependencies not yet installed
2. TypeScript server needs packages to resolve imports

**Solution**: Just run `npm install` (Step 1 above)
