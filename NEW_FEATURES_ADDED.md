## 📈 Performance Considerations

### AllTasksView Optimization

```typescript
// Efficiently flattens all tasks with member info
const allTasksWithMembers = members.flatMap(member =>
  member.tasks.map(task => ({
    ...task,
    memberName: member.name,
    memberAvatar: member.avatar,
    // ... more info
  }))
);

// Memoized selector could be added for this
```

**Recommendation**: Create a memoized selector for this if team grows large.

### Dark Mode Performance

- Uses CSS classes (no JavaScript re-rendering)
- localStorage for persistence
- Instant theme switching
